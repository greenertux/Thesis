See comment in PubMed Commons below The pathogenesis of dengue virus (DV) infection has not been completely defined and change of redox status mediated by depletion of glutathione (GSH) in host cell is a common result of viral infection. Our previous study has demonstrated that DV serotype 2 (DV2) infection alters host intracellular GSH levels, and exogenous GSH inhibits viral production by modulating the activity of NF-κB in HepG2 cells. GSH is the most powerful intracellular antioxidant and involved in viral infections. Thus, this study was to investigate whether DV2 infection can induce alteration in redox balance and effect of GSH on the disease in HepG2 xenografts SCID mice. Our results revealed that mice infected with DV2 showed alterations in oxidative stress by increasing the level of malondialdehyde (MDA), an end product of lipid peroxidation, and GSSG/GSH ratio. DV2-infected mice also showed a decrease in the activity of catalase (CAT) and total superoxide dismutase (T-SOD) in the serum and/or observed organs, especially the liver. Moreover, DV2 infection resulted in elevated serum levels of the cytokines tumor necrosis factor-α and interlukin-6 and obvious histopathological changes in the liver. The administration of exogenous GSH significantly reversed all of the aforementioned pathological changes and prevented significant liver damage. Furthermore, in vitro treatment of HepG2 cells with antioxidants such as GSH inhibited viral entry as well as the production of reactive oxygen species in HepG2 cells. These results suggest that GSH prevents DV2-induced oxidative stress and liver injury in mice by inhibiting proinflammatory cytokine production, and GSH and may be a promising therapeutic agent for prevention of oxidative liver damage during DV infection. 23383181; Wang J PloS one. 2013/2/6

B: Histopathological examination of the liver and brain in DV2-infected HepG2-SCID mice with or without antioxidant administration. Uninfected HepG2-SCID mice were used as controls (C). DV2-infected HepG2-SCID mice were administered with 0.9% NaCl, GSH (8 mg/day per mouse), NAC (1 mg/day per mouse) or Vitamin C (Vit C, 1 mg/day per mouse) for seven days. C: HepG2 transplanted mice without DV2 infection. Liver sections showed hemorrhage (H), inflammatory cell infiltration (I), edema (E) and severe congestion (arrows) in the NaCl, NAC and Vit C treatment groups, whereas GSH treatment ameliorated the above histopathological changes. Similarly, brain sections of the NaCl, NAC, and Vit C groups showed slight congestion (arrows), and there was no obvious change in the GSH group.

DV2-infected HepG2 cells treated with antioxidants or BSO altered ROS levels. ×100 magnification.Inhibitory Effect of Glutathione on Oxidative Liver Injury Induced by Dengue Virus Serotype 2 Infections in MicePLoS One. 2013;8(1):e55407.Figure 7Effect of antioxidants and buthionine sulfoximine (BSO) on the entry of DV2 into HepG2 cells.Confluent monolayers of HepG2 cells were infected with DV2 at 1 of multiplicity of infection (MOI). Medium containing Glutathione (GSH) or BSO was incubated with HepG2 cells during the virus adsorption period. Then, the cells were washed three times and freeze-thawed to release intracellular virus. Virus titers were detected by using the plaque assay and were expressed as a percentage of the DV2-infected group that did not receive treatment. DV2: DV2 infected HepG2 cells (MOI = 1), DV2+GSH: DV2 infected HepG2 cells with GSH treatment of 10 mM or 20 mM, DV2+BSO: DV2 infected HepG2 cells with BSO treatment of 0.2 mM or 1 mM.
